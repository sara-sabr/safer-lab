# Segment and Separate

## Objective

Segment and separate information based on sensitivity of information.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Develop a target network security design that considers segmentation via network security zones, in alignment with [ITSG-22](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/baseline-security-requirements-network-security-zones-government-canada-itsg-22) and [ITSG-38](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/network-security-zoning-design-considerations-placement-services-within-zones-itsg-38).
* [ ] Implement increased levels of protection for devices.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm that SAFER lab devices cannot be connected to ESDC network.
* [ ] Confirm that SAFER lab devices cannot transfer data to and from ESDC network through storage devices.

## Applicable Service Models

* SAFER devices
