# SAFER Lab Guardrails

This project will host the guardrails the SAFER lab will adhere to and implement. The users of this project will be IT Research and Prototyping employees during the duration of the **pilot**. The idea is modeling and inspired from  [GC Cloud Guardrails](https://canada-ca.github.io/cloud-guardrails/).

## Purpose

The purpose of the guardrails is to ensure we have a baseline set of controls within the SAFER lab. These guardrails ensure we remain secure within 30 days of a device type being onboarded.
