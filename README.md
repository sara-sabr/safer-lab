# SAFER Lab

This proof of concept (PoC) will host the SAFER Lab information in an open manner for discussion and collaboration as it continiously evolves.

## Vision

A "library" with an inventory of multiple device types to enable all ESDC employees an equal opportunity to:

1. Try new technologies and learn about them.
2. Test their products will a multitude of devices/ecosystems.
3. Investigate new and existing technology capabilities to understand impacts/risks to ESDC.
4. Prototype ideas earlier to quickly determine business value.

## Scope

The SAFER lab will be built in phases:

- Phase 1: Buy devices and determine how to operate it with limited patrons who can access the lab.
    - Devices will remain off ESDC/GC network.
    - Patron process
    - Tooling exploration.
    - Try different ways to manage the devices.
- Phase 2: Expand and formalize the process so all ESDC employees could access the library.
    - Buy more devices and expand device type options.
    - Self service kiosk.
    - Option analysis on possibilities to have ESDC network access.

## Goals

### Goal 1 - Lab Management Automation

The lab will strive to be as automated as possible in the management of all devices to reduce employee committment requirements. This will be done through:

1. Automatic Imaging devices as they are returned.
2. If This, Then That (IFFT) rules based on logs and analytics against devices
3. Kiosk loan system similar to [McGill](https://blogs.library.mcgill.ca/hsslibrary/laptop-kiosk-laptop-lending-thanks-aus/)
4. Leverage what's available in the open source community to reduce efforts.

### Goal 2 - Provide a diverse set of devices

Provide a diverse set of loaner devices available to all employees thereby reducing the need for different teams to purchase it themselves. You are a patron of the lab if you are an employee of ESDC regardless of role, function, location and reporting relationships.

### Goal 3 - Provide Guardrails

Enable employees to try stuff out within the context of the guardrails. These guardrails will be implemented through programming and automated as much as possible to ensure they are being followed.

### Goal 4 - User Experience

The lab user experience must be simple and clear to all parties without requiring a lawyer to truely understand what the policy or MOU states.

## Inventory

The lab will start off with the following:
- Mac Laptops
- ChomeOS Laptops
- Linux Laptops
- Google Home Mini
- Amazon Echo Dot
- MIFIs
- Samsung Galaxy S9
- Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 2
- iPhone X
- iPad Pro
