# SAFER Lab

This proof of concept will host the SAFER Lab information in an open manner.

## Vision

The SAFER lab's vision is to enable ESDC to innovate and try new technologies without impacting ESDC network/security. This enables employees to have the same power as if they were using their personal devices, so a fleet of devices that can be borrowed will everyone has an equal opportunity to try/test/research/prototype what is needed to improve the lives of  Canadians.

## Scope
A set of devices that are off ESDC and GC network. These devices are managed through MOUs and controls, however usability and security will be balanced to ensure flexibility. To ensure at not time information on Canadian's are at risk, only **unclassifed** data will be allowed to leverage this proof of concept.
